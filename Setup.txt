Here is how things are set up in Unity:

1) Before opening this project in Unity, look at README.md for basic setup steps
    you should do first.

2) The camera and related components come from MR Design Tools
    (see https://github.com/Microsoft/MRDesignLabs_Unity/tree/master/DesignLabs_Unity_Examples)
  a) Add the HoloLens prefab from HUX/Prefabs/Interface/HoloLens
  b) Under it, on the InteractionManager, select only Tap, Hold, Manipulation Translate
  c) ManipulationManager should already have the BoundingBoxShell and AppBar

3) Speech input:
  a) Remove the default KeywordRecognizer from the AudioManager under HoloLens
  b) Add a KeywordRecognizer that autostarts with the keyword triggers:
      Measure object
      Follow me
      Stop following
      Replay path
      What are you doing

4) Text to speech:
    a) Create an AudioSource on an empty GameObject that is a child of CameraRig and
      position it approximately 0.6 units above the camera. This orientation will sound
      similar to Cortana's speech in the OS. It should have "Play on Awake"
      and the Spatial Blend should be all the way over to 3D
   b) Add a TextToSpeechManager component anywhere in your scene and link (drag and drop)
      the audio source you created in the last step to link it with the manager.
      Make sure you initialize the TextToSpeechManager textToSpeech = GetComponent...
      some milliseconds before you use it to speak.

5) Measure prefab:
    a) Basic cube mesh filter, stretched in the x direction (scale: 0.3, 0.1, 0.1)
    b) Box collider (not trigger), mesh renderer
    c) CompoundButton script. Filter tag is "Hidden" (need to make this tag).
      Make button state Interactive and require Gaze?
      No need for collider or renderer?
    d) BoundingBoxTarget script
      Tag on selected: Hidden, Tag on deselected: Default
      Permitted operations: Drag, ScaleUniform, RotateY (Hopefully we can get Scale X,Y,Z)

6) SpatialMapping:
    a) Add SpatialMapping (say, under HoloLens)
      *) Add the sample room mesh under Assets/SampleRoom/SampleSpatialMapping to
          the SpatialMapping's ObjectSurfaceObserver RoomModel script
    b) Create a GameObject called SpatialProcessing (again under HoloLens)
      *) Add SurfaceMeshesToPlanes to SpatialProcessing and the
          HoloToolkit SpatialMapping/Prefabs/SurfacePlane prefab to its SurfacePlanePrefab
          DrawPlanes - Wall, Floor, Ceiling
      *) Add RemoveSurfaceVertices to SpatialProcessing
