Here is how things are set up in Unity:

1) Before opening this project in Unity, look at README.md for basic setup steps
    you should do first.

2) The camera and related components come from MR Design Tools
    (see https://github.com/Microsoft/MRDesignLabs_Unity/tree/master/DesignLabs_Unity_Examples)
  a) Add the HoloLens prefab from HUX/Prefabs/Interface/HoloLens
  b) Under it, on the InteractionManager, select only Tap, Hold, Manipulation Translate
  c) ManipulationManager should already have the BoundingBoxShell and AppBar
    *) We make our own copy of the BoundingBoxShell and put it in prefabs
    *) Our BoundingBoxShell should have 0 scale padding, and for permitted
       operations select Drag, RotateY, ScaleX, ScaleY, ScaleZ
       Do not flatten
       Accept input
       Manipulating now
    *) We'll try it without an app bar.

    *) Our AppBar should just have the Adjust/Done button (if we use)
    *) Our BoundingBoxShell should have 0 scale padding, and for permitted
       operations select Drag, RotateY, ScaleX, ScaleY, ScaleZ
*/
       
3) Measure prefab:
    a) Basic cube mesh filter, stretched in the x direction (scale: 0.3, 0.1, 0.1)
    b) Box collider (not trigger), mesh renderer
    c) CompoundButton script. Filter tag is "Hidden" (need to make this tag).
      Make button state Interactive and require Gaze
      No need for main collider or main renderer?
    d) BoundingBoxTarget script
      Tag on selected: Hidden, Tag on deselected: Default
      Permitted operations: Drag, ScaleUniform, RotateY (Hopefully we can get Scale X,Y,Z)
      Try unselecting Toolbar Display
      Flattening mode: Do not flatten

3) Speech input:
  a) Under the KeywordManager on the AudioManager under HoloLens add a "SpeechReciever":
    *) Set up the following keyword triggers and map them to the GameController:
        Measure object        M
        Come with me          C
        Put it down           P
        Replay solution       R
        Next step             N
        Again                 A
        What are you doing    ?

4) Text to speech:
    a) Create an AudioSource on an empty GameObject that is a child of CameraRig and
      position it approximately 0.6 units above the camera. This orientation will sound
      similar to Cortana's speech in the OS. It should have "Play on Awake"
      and the Spatial Blend should be all the way over to 3D
   b) Add the TextToSpeech script to the same object and link (drag and drop)
      the audio source you created in the last step to link it with the manager.
      In your code, make sure you initialize the TextToSpeech textToSpeech = GetComponent...
      some milliseconds before you use it to speak.

6) SpatialMapping:
    a) Add SpatialMapping prefab (say, under HoloLens)
    b) Add the sample room mesh under Assets/SampleRoom/SampleSpatialMapping to
          the SpatialMapping's ObjectSurfaceObserver RoomModel script
